{"title": "Bioinformatics", "text": "\nIn the field of bioinformatics, SVMs have been widely used for tasks like protein classification or gene expression analysis. In protein classification, SVMs can predict the function or structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. SVMs can also be used to analyze gene expression data and identify genes associated with certain diseases or conditions. The ability of SVMs to handle high-dimensional data and their robustness against noisy data makes them suitable for analyzing complex biological datasets.\n\n", "curator": "A. C."}
