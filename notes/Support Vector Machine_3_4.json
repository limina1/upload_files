{"title": "Anomaly Detection", "text": "\nSupport Vector Machines can also be employed for anomaly detection. Anomaly detection involves identifying unusual patterns or observations that deviate significantly from the norm. SVMs can be trained on a dataset that primarily contains normal instances and then used to detect instances that do not conform to the normal behavior. This makes SVMs useful for detecting fraudulent transactions, network intrusions, or equipment failures.\n\n", "curator": "A. C."}
