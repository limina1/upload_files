{"title": "Image Classification", "text": "\nSVMs can also be applied to image classification tasks. Given a set of images with different objects or scenes, SVMs can learn to distinguish between different classes. The images are usually represented as feature vectors derived from various image descriptors, such as color histograms or texture features. The SVM algorithm then learns to separate these feature vectors into different categories. This makes SVMs useful in applications such as image recognition, object detection, and face recognition.\n\n", "curator": "A. C."}
